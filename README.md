### Abstract

**Goal:** In this work, we present an extensive description and evaluation of our method for blood vessel segmentation in fundus images based on a discriminatively trained fully connected conditional random field model. **Methods:** Standard segmentation priors such as a Potts model or total variation usually fail when dealing with thin and elongated structures. We overcome this difficulty by using a conditional random field model with more expressive potentials, taking advantage of recent results enabling inference of fully connected models almost in real time. Parameters of the method are learned automatically using a structured output support vector machine, a supervised technique widely used for structured prediction in a number of machine learning applications. **Results:** Our method, trained with state of the art features, is evaluated both quantitatively and qualitatively on four publicly available datasets: DRIVE, STARE, CHASEDB1, and HRF. Additionally, a quantitative comparison with respect to other strategies is included. Conclusion: The experimental results show that this approach outperforms other techniques when evaluated in terms of sensitivity, F1-score, G-mean, and Matthews correlation coefficient. Additionally, it was observed that the fully connected model is able to better distinguish the desired structures than the local neighborhood-based approach. **Significance:** Results suggest that this method is suitable for the task of segmenting elongated structures, a feature that can be exploited to contribute with other medical and biological applications.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

We make use of some external libraries in our code, namely:

 - VLFeat: for efficient ROC curve computation. [[link]](https://github.com/vlfeat/vlfeat)
 - Soares *et al.* code for Gabor filters.
 - Nguyen *et al.* code for line detectors.
 - Azzopardi *et al.* code for B-COSFIRE filters (only for reproducing segmentation results used in SIPAIM 2016). [[link]](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/49172-trainable-cosfire-filters-for-vessel-delineation-with-application-to-retinal-images). If you use this code, please cite the following papers:
    - [1] George Azzopardi, Nicola Strisciuglio, Mario Vento, Nicolai Petkov, Trainable COSFIRE filters for vessel delineation with application to retinal images, Medical Image Analysis, Available online 3 September 2014, ISSN 1361-8415, http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.media.2014.08.002.
    - [2] “N. Strisciuglio, G. Azzopardi, M. Vento, and N. Petkov” - Supervised vessel delineation in retinal fundus images with the automatic selection of B-cosfire filters. Machine Vision and Applications, http://doi:10.1007/s00138-016-0781-7

These two libraries are included by default in `fundus-vessel-segmentation-tbme/external` and `fundus-vessel-segmentation-tbme/core/Features/Features`, respectively.

It will also require to download some data sets like. This is a list of some data sets that you can use:

 - [DRIVE](www.isi.uu.nl/Research/Databases/DRIVE/). It is necessary for training the model we used for SIPAIM 2016.
 - [STARE](http://cecas.clemson.edu/~ahoover/stare/probing/index.html).
 - [CHASEDB1](https://blogs.kingston.ac.uk/retinal/chasedb1/).
 - [HRF](https://www5.cs.fau.de/research/data/fundus-images/).

We include code for preparing DRIVE data for training and evaluating both the SIPAIM 2016 and TBME 2017 versions of our segmentation method. A similar file organization has to be followed for computation.

### Installing

 1. Create a fork of this repository, or clone it by doing:
```git
$ git clone https://github.com/ignaciorlando/fundus-vessel-segmentation-tbme
```
 2. Update submodules doing:

 ```git
 $ git submodule update --init --recursive
 ```
 3. Open MATLAB (I used MATLAB R2015a) and move to `fundus-vessel-segmentation-tbme` folder.
 4. Run `setup_segmentation_code` to compile all MEX files and to add necessary folders to the MATLAB path. This will also create a copy of the configuration files in ```./default_configuration```, putting them into a new folder, namely ```./configuration```.
 5. Everything is ready to run!

> **Note:** We include binaries for Windows, UNIX and Mac architectures, that were tested on Windows 7 and 10, Ubuntu 14.04 and on a Macbook PRO Retina 2015 with macOS Sierra. In principle there would be no problem on using this system within other architectures or operating systems as far as you run ```setup_segmentation_code``` first.

### Code organization

The repository is organized in the following folders:

  - ```./api```: contains scripts that you can use for training the model or running experiments.
  - ```./configuration```: contains a series of configuration scripts that are called by the scripts in ```./api``` before doing anything. You can modify the variables in these scripts at your will, but take into account that no modification on the files will be committed to your repository as it is ignored.
  - ```./core```: contains the essential functions of this code, including features, SOSVM learning and FC-CRF and LNB-CRF wrappers.
  - ```./data_preparation```: contains scripts to prepare some data sets for further processing.
  - ```./default_configuration```: contains all the default configuration files, that will be copied to ```./configuration``` when running ```setup_segmentation_code```. Any modification here will be committed if you push to your repository, so take that into account.
  - ```./evaluation```: contains functions to evaluate segmentation results compared to gold standard segmentations.
  - ```./external```: contains external libraries.
  - ```./fundus-util```: is a git submodule from a different repository. Please, remember to do ```git submodule update --init --recursive``` after cloning.

By default, our code might create 3 additional folders that are ignored by git:

  - ```./data```: will contain the data sets.
  - ```./data/results```: will contain the results obtained in the experiments.
  - ```./data/segmentation_model```: will contain the model learned from DRIVE when reproducing SIPAIM 2016 method.

## Running experiments

Scripts for running experiments are in the `./api` folder. All filenames are quite self-explanatory, but if you have any questions do not hesitate in opening issues in my github repository.

In general, all experiments will require to edit a configuration script. They are all in the `./configuration` folder.

## Extending the repository

### Add your own custom features

Adding your own custom features is relatively easy.

1. Add your feature extraction function to ```./core/Features/Features```, following this signature:

```matlab
  output = <feature_name>(image, mask, unary, options)
```

where:

  - ```output```: is the response of the input ```image``` to your feature function.
  - ```image```: is the input image.
  - ```mask```: is the input FOV mask.
  - ```unary```: is a logical value indicating if the feature is being extracted for the unary potentials. If ```false```, it is used for the pairwise potentials. **I strongly recommend you to use a multidimensional version of your features when ```unary==true``` and a one-dimensional representation when ```unary==false```. Otherwise, the inference of the fully connected CRF will take a lot.**
  - ```options```: is a MATLAB ```struct``` containing the required feature parameters as fields.

2. Edit ```./core/model_configuration/getGeneralConfiguration.m``` accordingly:

  1. Add a new field to the MATLAB struct ```options``` with the following format: ```<feature_name>.<parameter_name>```, where ```<feature_name>``` is the same name that you use for your custom feature extraction function and ```<parameter_name>``` is one of the parameters that your function needs.
  2. Set custom values for all the parameters that you added to ```options.<feature_name>```.
  3. Add a reference to your custom feature extraction function to ```config.features.features```, as ```@<feature_name>```, where ```<feature_name>``` is the name of your custom feature extraction function.
  4. Add the name of your feature extraction method to ```config.features.featureNames```.
  5. Add a reference to your options field in ```config.features.featureParameters```.

> **Note:** Make sure that the options field added to ```config.features.featureParameters``` is in the same position than your ```<feature_name>``` function in the ```config.features.features``` cell array. Otherwise, your function will receive the wrong arguments and will fail.

3. Following the previous steps you have added your custom feature extraction function to the repository. Now you need to indicate that you want to use it during the learning/inference process. To do so, you need to modify ```./core/model_configuration/getConfiguration_GenericDataset.m```:

  - If you want to use your feature on the unary potentials, add a line ```config.features.unary.unaryFeatures(<N>) = 1;```, with ```<N>``` the position of your feature extraction function in ```config.features.features```.
  - If you want to use other features, repeat the same process that you followed before, using the corresponding ```<N>``` values.
  - If you want to use your feature on the pairwise potentials, modify the line ```config.features.pairwise.pairwiseFeatures(3) = 1;``` by changing 3 with your ```<N>``` value.
